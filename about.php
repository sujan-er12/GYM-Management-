            Limitations of Existing System
        </h4>

        <ul style="text-align: justify;width: 450px;margin-left: 700px;line-height: 30px;margin-top: 45px;
            font-family: fangsong;font-size: 15px;">
  
            <li>
                The existing System such as Gym Master is not as much as user (Customer) friendly as compare to our Proposed System.
            </li>
            <li>
                The communication with members is not well in Existing System because all
                the data is handled by Gym manager.
            </li>
            <li>
                Customers don’t get full accessibility to Gym center and all permissions are
                allowed only for Gym manager.
            </li>
            <li>
                Today’s System cannot take effort out of finances and debt collection
            </li>
            <li>
                Today’s systems are time taking software and cannot be easily install in Operating System like Linux , Vista , Mc-OS, and Novel. And also need high configuration of PC. Normal PC’s cannot install in it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lot of memory space is required for installing existing software.
            </li>
            <li>
                Existing Gym management software cannot perform all operation expected by manager such as keeping record of machinery maintenance and service data
            </li>
        </ul>
